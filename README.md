This is a TIC TAC TOE game.
It is made in Python with the help of modules PyGame and Sys.

Running the program will open a pygame window and two players will interact with the board until one of the players wins or the game is tied. 
Upon winning, the winner's selection (X or O) will turn green.

The code and other resources have been provided.
All the calculations within the code have been optimized to suit the GUI.
